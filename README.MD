# MLFR_Sensor

## Micro_Laser_Filament_Runout_Sensor

### MLFR_Sensor is 3D printer filament runout sensor based on VCNT2030 Reflective Optical sensor.
### It uses microscopic IR laser and a phototransistor to detect transparent and less reflective materials.

Supply voltage: +5V

Logic: Active Low
