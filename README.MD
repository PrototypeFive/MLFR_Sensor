MLFR_Sensor

Micro_Laser_Filament_Runout_Sensor

MLFR_Sensor is 3D printer filament runout sensor based on VCNT2030 Reflective Optical sensor.
It uses microscopic IR laser and a phototransistor to detect transparent and less reflective materials.

Supply voltage: +5V

Logic: Active Low

Print enclosure base with black. 
Position vertical like on image. 
There is a sacrifical layer to be removed.
